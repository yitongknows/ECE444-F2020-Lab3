## Activity 3: Briefly summarize the difference between SQL or NoSQL database

SQL | NoSQL
------------ | -------------
Relational databases that uses fixed columns androws ( or tables) to store data | Non-relational databases that use documents (or graphs) to store data
Schema is pre-defined | Schema is dynamic
Complex joins query may be needed to retrieve data | No joins required, may be difficult to apply joins
Veritically scalable (increase the capacity of a singe server) | Horizontally scalable (adding more servers)
Use SQL to manipulate data | Querying depends on the database structure
